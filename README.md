- 👋 Hi, I’m @ProfMBN
- 👀 I’m interested in educating community members about blockchain's potential for social good, including law students, lawyers, policymakers, legislators and others.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to scale up our Blockchain Law for Social Good Center to include and amplify projects focused on blockchain and social impact.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on training/speaking opportunities, academic collaborations, funding opportunities for the Center.
- 📫 How to reach me: MNeitz@ggu.edu. Check out our Center: https://blockchainlawsg.org/
